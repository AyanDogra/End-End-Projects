# Predictive Maintenance on Pump Sensor Data 
This notebook identifies the use case of a pump sensor dataset and works in developing a basic time-series model to predictive the breakdown of a pump in the next 30 days.
It helps to identiy breakdown and hence is useful economically.

## Pump Sensor Data 
This file contains the visulization for the dataset which is further used in model building.

## Pump Predictive Maintenance
This file contains the final model that is built on the provided dataset.
The method used for building this model is Remaining Useful Life of the machine to identify breakdown.
